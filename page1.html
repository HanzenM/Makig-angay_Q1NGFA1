            <li>The Dakar Rally or simply "The Dakar", formerly known as the "Parisâ€“Dakar Rally", is an annual rally raid organised by the Amaury Sport Organisation.</li>
            <li>The rally is an off-road endurance event. The terrain that the competitors traverse is much tougher than that used in conventional rallying, and the vehicles used are typically true off-road vehicles and motorcycles, rather than modified on-road vehicles.</li>
